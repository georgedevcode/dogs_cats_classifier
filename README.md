# Dogs & Cats Classifier

On this project I used Machine Learning techniques to classify if the sound of the animal is a Cat or a Dog. 

The project also includes a audio_scraper Jupyter Notebook which is used to scrape the audio from Youtube videos that later are going to use as the dataset for the Machine Learning Model.

Additionally, the Librosa Python library was used to manipulate the audio files to later on training the ML models.


## Librosa API      

[Documentation](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)

Librosa is a Python library that is widely used in the field of music and audio signal processing. It provides a wide range of functionalities for analyzing and manipulating audio data, making it a valuable tool for machine learning (ML) projects that involve audio.

Librosa offers various features for audio processing, including:

Loading audio files: Librosa allows you to load audio files in different formats, such as WAV or MP3, and provides easy access to audio data.

Feature extraction: It provides a collection of functions to extract various audio features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, chroma features, and rhythm features. These features can be used as inputs for ML algorithms to train models for tasks like speech recognition, music genre classification, or audio event detection.
